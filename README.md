# LinkBit
A Decentralized Community Token
Licensed under MIT
The LinkBit Token (TLB) is a proof of concept cryptocurrency. It
will be used to show oﬀ, that it isn’t necessary for a token to have any special
properties or intrinsic valuable properties whatsoever to be valuable. Therefore,
the value of the token will be decided only by the token holders / community
alone.

LinkBit is a ERC20-Token, which will be created by using some Copy-and-Paste
Code found randomly on the internet. The number of available tokens will be
limited to 1000000 (one million), and can only be sent, bought and sold by 
increments of 1.
